# CB-Code-Challenge-

Two coding puzzles 

1. Given a string, write a function or method that takes in that string, and returns the same string in reverse order.
• Example: Given the string “Hello”, your program would return “olleH”

2. Given a string, return the character count for each distinct character in the string.
• Example: "abacca" -> a: 3, b: 1, c: 2
